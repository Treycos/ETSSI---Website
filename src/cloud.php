                        <p>Today, in 2019, businesses are experiencing the digital revolution more than taking advantage of it. 
                            That’s why more and more of them are outsourcing their IT and information systems. 
                            This does not mean that companies use IT tools to increase their competitiveness and facilitate their work. 
                            The choice of tools and their management is often by default more than by real choice and projection on the future. 
                            The issue of security is too often evaded as regulations get tougher year by year and attacks on computer systems are more and more multiple and regular. 
                            This is why we have worked on the different tools and methods to enter the new digital age 
                                by taking into account all the constraints and issues that apply to the outsourcing of the information system.</p>
